Description 
I was exploring different methods to evade AV engines which will be helpful during Pen-testing Engagements. Since most of the malware's are written on C#, C++ and python(Because it supports cross-platform).Most of the PowerShell and DDE injection methods were detected with AV solution so I taught of giving a try with golang because Go has many features such as concurrency and also its compiled to machine code so it has good performance.
